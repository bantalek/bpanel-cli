// If you're adding a whole new view/Panel
// you'll want this to get props from the state, through
// Panel and to your specific route

// mapComponentDispatch will use react-redux's connect to
// retrieve props from the state, but we need a way
// for the Panel Container to pass it down to the plugin's Route view
// props getters like this are used in the app to pass new props
// added by plugins down to children components (such as your plugin)
// The Route props getter is special since different routes will want diff props
// so we pass the getter as the value of an object prop, w/ the key
// corresponding to the route that needs the props
export const getRouteProps = {
  [metadata.name]: (parentProps, props) =>
    Object.assign(props, {
      // myProp: parentProps.myProp,
    })
